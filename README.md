# CS6930 Data Mining

![](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=done)

## Description of Course
This course introduces ***concepts, algorithms, and techniques of data mining*** as well as the practical issues that arise when applying these algorithms to real-world problems. 

You learn various aspects of data mining, including **classification, prediction, ensemble methods, association rules, sequence mining, time series mining and cluster analysis**. 

*  **The homework assignments** consist of both theory (written) and programming components. 

*  **The class project** involves building a predictive model using a real-world large data sets.

## Prerequisites
The students are expected to:

1. Have knowledge in data structures, algorithms, basic linear algebra, and basic statistics.

2. Familiar with at least one programming language, and have programming experiences.
