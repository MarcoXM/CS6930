**Linear Regression**<br>
This _file_ will help you to better operate the python file in **_seconds_** !!<br>
And the code can also be found in [Github](https://github.com/MarcoXM/CS6930)<br>

Instructions
-------
<br>
Before running the python file of ZIP IN BLACK BOARD !!!!  <br>


I have uploaded the dataset file in **erdos**<br>

`/u/erdos/csga/xwang423/HW1_Code/`<br>
<br>
![data](https://github.com/MarcoXM/CS6930/blob/master/dataset.png)<br>
<br>
And it would answer questions in **three** parts:<br>

1.Best λ for _train & test set_ : <br>
------------
the best λ for train 1000-100 is :**0**<br>
Least MSE of 1000-100 is :5.210034703130469<br>
the best λ for test 1000-100 is :**45**<br>
Least MSE of 1000-100 is :6.389138883301893<br>
the best λ for train 100-100 is :**1**<br>
Least MSE of is :0.469300180516516<br>
the best λ for test 100-100 is :**24**<br>
Least MSE of is :6.965437997045956<br>
the best λ for train 100-10is :**0**<br>
Least MSE of is :5.450043520977648<br>
the best λ for test 100-10 is :**98**<br>
Least MS of is :6.258031077165364<br>

CV the best MSE for train 100(1000-100) is :0.6622087218213889<br>
CV the best MSE for test 100(1000-100) is :5.887865778203181<br>
CV the best λ for 150(1000-100) is :38<br>
CV the best MSE for train 150(1000-100) is :1.57391743639321<br>
CV the best MSE for test 100(1000-100)is :6.828977719053216<br>





3.Learning curve & data size
-------------

It would generate a set of beautiful and insightful graph, which show the **Relationship between Size of data and Learning Curve**. <br>

λ = 1 :<br>
![λ = 1"](https://github.com/MarcoXM/CS6930/blob/master/L_1.png)

λ = 25 :<br>
![λ = 1"](https://github.com/MarcoXM/CS6930/blob/master/L_25.png)

λ = 150 :<br>
![λ = 1"](https://github.com/MarcoXM/CS6930/blob/master/L_150.png)
