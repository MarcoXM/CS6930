**Instruction**<br>


Before running the python file of ZIP IN BLACK BOARD !!!!  <br>

I have also uploaded the Answers file in **erdos** too, and it could run although **dramatically** slow<br>

`/u/erdos/csga/xwang423/HW4_Code/`<br>

Plz after download the files in blackboard. Making sure that **datasets and Python files** are in the same **folder**!!!

Thank you for running my code.
